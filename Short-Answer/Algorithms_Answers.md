#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)o(n) because the run time will become slower as bigger inputs are placed into the snippit, the growth is linear 


b) o(n^2) because the growth is exponential due to the loops. 


c)o(n) because the function is called recursively n times before reaching the base case

## Exercise II
